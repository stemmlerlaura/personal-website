        <p> Hi! My name is Laura Stemmler Hermida, and I recently completed a Master's degree in Mathematics at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. I was born in Madrid, Spain, but I had the good fortune of studying in different countries. </p>
        <p>Durante my master's, I specialized in algorithmic complexity. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. </p>
        <p>My current interests include algorithms and applications of mathematics in finance. 
        </p>
        <p> On this site, I share some of my notes and materials I've gathered throughout my studies. They are a work in progress and may contain some errors, but I hope they are helpful and interesting to other students!</p>
